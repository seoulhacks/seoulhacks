								<h2> Is food provided? </h2>
								<p> Lunch, dinner, and a few light snacks are provided at the venue, but you are also free to order food there to your preference. We recommend that you eat breakfast before you arrive since it will be a long day. <p>
							</div>
							<div class="card card-expand">
								<h2> Do you need experience as a programmer? </h2>
								<p> This competition is specifically targeted as a "learnathon." While experience does help, our mentors will guide you from start to finish in making a project that you want to make with your group. <p>
							</div>
							<div class="card card-expand">
								<h2> What if you're not a programmer? </h2>
								<p> Programming is a skill that anyone can pick up; we have the best mentors to be able to facilitate your learning. That said, skills like graphic design, sound design, and expertise in any other subject can be just as valuable as programming to your group. <p>
							</div>
							<div class="card card-expand">
								<h2> Are there awards? </h2>
								<p> Yes! While this is not aimed to be a competitive hackathon, awards along with various prizes are availble to the best and most creative projects. There will be one grand prize and a few surprise sub-prizes, but one project will only be able to one award. <p>
							</div>
							<div class="card card-expand">
								<h2> What will the event look like? </h2>
								<p> After participants arrive at the event, the programming theme will be released and teams will be allocated to their respective mentors. Subsequently teams will be given until 8:00pm to work on their application with their respective mentors. Lunch, dinner, and other fun events will take place during this programming period. Lastly, teams will have a chance to do a quick demo of their application to other teams, then prizes and awards will be announced. <p>
