								<h2> Do you need experience as a programmer? </h2>
								<p> This competition is specifically targeted as a "learnathon." While experience does help, our mentors will guide you from start to finish in making a project that you want to make with your group. <p>

								<h2> What if you're not a programmer? </h2>
								<p> Programming is a skill that anyone can pick up; we have the best mentors to be able to facilitate your learning. That said, skills like graphic design, sound design, and expertise in any other subject can be just as valuable as programming to your group. <p>

								<h2> Are there awards? </h2>
								<p> Yes! While this is not aimed to be a competitive hackathon, awards along with various prizes are availble to the best and most creative projects. There will be one grand prize and a few surprise sub-prizes, but one project will only be able to one award. <p>
