<p>Thank you for joining SeoulHacks, we hope that this will be an opportunity for you to have fun and explore programming. If you haven’t already, please join our discord server at <a href="https://discord.gg/vAvNZZqQWV">https://discord.gg/vAvNZZqQWV</a>. Announcements and other news will be posted on Discord first.</p>
<p>Experienced participants of hackathons will know what to do, but we encourage beginners to read along this short guide to help them along the process</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>The first step to any hackathon is effective communication with your team mates. Choose any channel of communication that works, such as Discord, Skype, or Messenger.</p>
<p>Depending on the size of your team, we would also recommend the use of tools like Trello which will help your organize the tasks at hand. Considering that you’re trying to make a small project at high velocity, it might be better to separate domains entirely, such as splitting between backend/frontend.</p>
<p><a href="http://Repl.it">Repl.it</a> is a great online IDE to collaborate with programming. Think of it like google docs,  but for code.</p>
<h2 id="brainstorming">Brainstorming</h2>
<p>Brainstorming can sometimes be very easy, other times very difficult. The important things to look out for are the following qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Accomplishable</em>: An idea simple enough you could feasibly create a “Minimum Viable Product” (MVP) within the time limit.</li>
<li><em>Interesting</em>: This sounds general, but it’s a necessary quality. The project that you pursue should resonate and interest you. Note that for a project to be interesting, it doesn’t have to be complicated or even unique. Copying another project is fine, as long as you don’t copy-and-paste code and make some changes of your own.</li>
<li><em>Fit the prompt</em>: As SeoulHacks is a themed hackathon, we suggest that your project should fit the prompt. However, don’t be confined by the prompt. The relationship to the prompt can be a bit of a stretch, but as long as it is backed by sound reasoning we will accept it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s some resources which have some ideas available to you:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas">https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mdnahian/Common-Hackathon-Projects">https://github.com/mdnahian/Common-Hackathon-Projects</a></li>
<li>Things that annoy you in your life (Why can’t my computer do this for me?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, just because you came upon an idea doesn’t mean you should commit a hundred percent. Make sure to test out the feasibility of that project through a brief period of research. Furthermore, if you or your team is having trouble coming up with an idea, don’t hesitate to reach out to mentors.</p>
<h2 id="the-minimum-viable-product">The Minimum Viable Product</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the Brainstorming section, the main goal of a hackathon is not to create a finished product, but a proof of concept. With that in mind, don’t set out to get things <em>right</em>, try to get things <em>done</em>. Don’t worry if the final result is a little bit shabby. In fact, almost all hackathon projects are a bit sharp around the edges.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>The implementation of your idea at a basic level divides into two categories, the <strong>client</strong> and the <strong>backend</strong>. The client is what faces the consumer, or the user of your app. For beginners, we recommend that you go with projects that only require a client, reducing your workload.</p>
<p>There are many ways to bring a project to life, however we recommend beginners to create either a <strong>website</strong> or a <strong>console based application</strong>. Compared to iOS and Android apps, there’s less of a learning curve. Here’s a curated list of tutorials to get you started.</p>
